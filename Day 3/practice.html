    <h3>Starbucks brings back Pumpkin Spice Latte earlier than ever</h3>
    <p>
      The company announced the return of its iconic fall beverage in a
      statement released Wednesday. According to the news release, the fall menu
      will be available across all Starbucks locations in the US this Thursday,
      marking “the unofficial start of the season.” This year marks the 21st
      year in a row that Pumpkin Spice Latte has earned a spot on the fall menu
      since its debut in 2003. In addition to the returning seasonal items, the
      coffee chain has launched the new Iced Apple Crisp Nondairy Cream Chai.
      Rosalyn Batingan, a Starbucks beverage developer, said, “We are excited to
      introduce the new Iced Apple Crisp Nondairy Cream Chai to our customers.”
      “This beverage perfectly captures the taste and feeling of fall. We have
      combined creamy oatmilk with notes of cinnamon, clove and other warm
      baking spices from our chai tea to compliment the layered flavors of
      apple, cinnamon and brown sugar which are infused into the nondairy cold
      foam topping,” Batingan explained.
